Morgan Cook, Josh Green and Philip Ross: Team 1-F
Milestone 2

Instructions for building our operating system:
  -First, navigate to the folder m2. Then run ./compileOS.sh then run bochs -f opsys.bxrc

Instructions for testing and using our operating system:
  -The OS starts by printing "Hello World!"  It then prompts the use to enter a line.  Write a line here and press enter.  It will echo your line back to you using the printString() and readString() methods.  It will then show a line of text that indicates that it successfully read the given sector.  Lastly, the user is prompted to enter another line of input.  Again, write a line here and press enter.  It will echo your line back to you using the InterruptHandler21.  It will also show another message that indicates that it successfully read a sector through using InterruptHandler21.

  -Our code does not currently have any bugs or deficiencies.
